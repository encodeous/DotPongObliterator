# `Dot-Pong Obliterator`

_I suck at this game— but this program can play better than any human alive or ever will be alive_

Try the game out at: https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/dots-pong

## Setting it up

- On a Windows machine, compile and run the code with .NET 7+
- When the game is ready, hit enter in the Console, and select the area where the game is located on the screen
- The program will detect when the game starts and ends and automatically play it for you!

*There are some bugs where the program will select the wrong color, but I cba fixing it!*
